    /*! \brief A fully distributed parallel time-dependent solver for linear
     * elasticity.
     *
     * Both the triangulation and the dofs are fully distributed, the algebraic
     * operations are done using PETSc wrappers offered by deal.II.
     * The output is also parallelized: every processor writes its own output,
     * ParaView is able to group them together.
     * The mesh refinement is parallelized too.
     *
     * The solution vectors, for example displacement, are declared as
     * non-ghosted vectors. There are two reasons for this: 1. we do not need
     * the dofs not owned by the current processor in assembly since the system
     * matrix is not dependent on the dofs at all;
     * 2. we need to do matrix/vector operations on these vectors, for example
     * add and vmult, this requires the vectors to be non-ghosted.
     *
     * Algorithm-wise, this class is not different from the serial version,
     * Newmark-beta method is used for time-discretization and
     * displacement-based finite element is used for space-discretization.
